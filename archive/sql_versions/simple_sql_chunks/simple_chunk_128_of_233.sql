It’s hard for me to understand looking back how I thought I was in compliance with our agreements when looking back I objectively just wasn’t. I reached out to Priscilla to talk through, as I realized yesterday morning how I’ve tapped into something much deeper and sadder and needier than I’ve been aware of…and really couldn’t communicate to you. The range of emotions this weekend was crazy…. From feeling frustrated and ashamed for taking us a step backwards after what I’ve felt has been two steps forward. To feeling both sexy and vulnerable with you exploring desire and sexuality and play. I can just be me with you…and only with you can I experience what it is like to lose myself…and sometimes not even be aware of where I end and you begin…physically and emotionally.

You needed time to finish getting ready and blow dry your hair. I was sitting on the red couch while chatting with him. Then you came upstairs looking stunning and sexy for him. And then you came back home and got in bed with me. I don’t remember whether you took a shower or not before you came into bed. But the thought of me wrapping my body around you after that with traces of him on you makes me feel sick. I feel lots of anger toward him. How he could come into my house like that and talk to me like that is a level of disrespect I could never imagine doing to someone else.
