I️’m trying hard to move past my grief and pain as quickly as I can. I️ know you didn’t want to hurt me and I️ know you were trying to accommodate with guardrails. And i also know I was giving you positive feedback along the way - when i felt like you were implementing the guardrails effectively. So i get that the messages were blurred. I️’m sorry that it wasn’t clearer.   I️ was desperately trying hard to make it work and to get past my own discomfort. I tried super hard to stuff down my emotions so that you could be happy in your exploration. Your happiness made me happy. But the anxiety just kept coming back over and over.   It makes me feel really really bad to ask you to change the configuration when I️ know you don’t want to. I️’m wish I️ could get comfortable with you having a full throttled relationship alongside of ours. But I️ just can’t. I️ hope you can find a way to not be mad at me for that.   I️’m at the tail end of these very intense feelings and I️ hope to be in a better place pretty soon. This experiment has taken an incredible toll on me. But I️ still am really committed to finding a way where you feel like you can have some of that exploration and external engagement that feels fun and exciting. I️ have it and I️ want you to have it too.   And I️ love you more than words. You are my rock and my foundation. And my primary in every way shape and form. Our connection and bond is the center of my universe. I️ love my life with you and I️ love everything about you - including and most notably your tender and very loving heart.
