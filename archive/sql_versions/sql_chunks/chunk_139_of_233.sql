I appreciate that you acted right away to put her in touch with Dan, but based on the fact that you have started/stopped with 2 other therapists, I’m a bit anxious   That you are going to quit and not have active support to do your personal work. I stand by what I said above…that I don’t want to use our couples therapy as the singular forum for this work. It’s not fair to me.  Also….to be clear….I am not telling you what or how to do this work. I understand that I have a very different approach than you do…and I honor that.  I’m still wrestling with where we landed regarding the lying…you have  been accountable for it being wrong and you regret it. When you told me though that the responsibility was 50/50, it made me anxious that you are not being fully accountable. Yes, your reaction was in response to my anger, and I have work to better self-regulate here, but there were many other possible ways that you could have responded …. And it is understandable that faced with you directly lying to me and trying to convince me otherwise…that it would activate my traumatic stress from your past betrayals and that i would become really angry. It was not unprovoked.  Some of my work is that there is a part of me I call “bad boy” who is filled with shame who by default assumes that I’m wrong and takes the blame for things.  He is the part who told me when our family calendar was not working…that it was my fault and I spent an hour troubleshooting before even considering it was your phone.  I struggle with you because sometimes I take on too much and sometimes I get defensive and push back too hard. I’m learning how to find the middle ground. When you tell me that this was 50/50 …. Just like your cheating was 50/50 it makes me scared that you aren’t being fully accountable, that a defensive part of you is pushing too much blame back on me (because I’ll sometimes accept it) and that this makes me question whether to fully trust you.  There is a deeper truth for you behind the defense of lying and hiding and betrayal that has nothing to do with me. Unless/until you recognize that there are unconscious stuff at play, I will be scared that the pattern will repeat itself…I don’t think it will happen the same way…I’m not afraid that you have some secret lovers behind the curtain…and I appreciate your commitment to transparency…..but in some other way.

And it is understandable that faced with you directly lying to me and trying to convince me otherwise…that i would become really angry. It was not unprovoked.  Some of my work is that there is a part of me I call “bad boy” who is filled with shame who by default assumes that I’m wrong and takes the blame for things.  He is the part who told me when our family calendar was not working…that it was my fault and I spent an hour troubleshooting before even considering it was your phone.  I struggle with when   I have two asks of you: 1. please read the book I gave you so that we may be able to have a discussion about my feedback. Can you tell me when you can do that? 2.
