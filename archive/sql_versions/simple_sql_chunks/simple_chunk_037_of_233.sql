In my conversation with David I mentioned how I had been feeling stressed initially, but that had subsided...he was like, ''well yeah....you''ve been through crazy change and you have a lot on your plate.'' I just felt validated...that it was normal. whereas with you, I know you haven''t meant it, but I''ve felt like there was something wrong with me. I do love being a parent and i can''t imagine not being with the boys all the time, but the last 9 months have been a hard adjustment for all of us. I''ve been able to celebrate the little victories...like with nathan yesterday and I want to make this the best summer ever.  You have been such an enormous help on so many fronts but then when you are gone for a while it reminds me how I''m still mostly a single parent of teenage boys who are going through massive changes of their own. It requires a bunch of energy and focus and I know I''m not doing everything right. But, I''m trying really hard. Sometimes instead of telling me how someone else expresses their love of being a parent more than I do, which just makes me feel bad, maybe just a few words of support and encouragement for what I''m doing.  You will experience the intensity of attachment and love you will have for our child.

I DO think you are taking responsibility and ownership for your kids development in a way that is really awesome. Nathan does need a lot of help and I''m very proud of you for giving it to him. And I love how much you care about them and prioritize them, so naturally. I also get how you can feel alone and that the brunt of all the work is on you. That''s definitely tough and it''s also true. Marla isn''t a responsible parent and I''m in awe of how much you have stepped up in her absence. It shows me a lot about your character and love for your children. Which are some of the reasons (among many others) why I''ve picked you to be the father of our child! Because you have the right instincts and love your kids so much. I''m sorry that I haven''t validated this enough for you as of late. I''m a hard driver and always striving for more. So sometimes I can take progress for granted and just keep going. But that doesn''t mean I don''t see all the movement and appreciate it. So thanks for shining a spotlight on this. And I do hope you can still find ways to help me feel excited about the baby we have cooking inside of me. You worked at it a few weeks ago and it made a big difference.
