I need to focus on the most revealing and difficult thing for me to square in the last 24hrs: You FORGOT that you had said, repeatedly to me, in front of Priscilla, that if you had to chose between our marriage and non-ethical non-monogamy, you would choose our marriage. I understand that you have shifted in your position…and this is not the point. You had no memory of even making that commitment.  When I brought this up….you were totally surprised. When I brought it up again…you were defensive…and not until I hammered again did you finally apologize. There is very important data for you here. I shared with you that my fear is that the same part of you that so badly wants connection that it is willing to engage in behavior that is hurtful to others, will come out in other ways. Here she is. This is the way the unconscious works…it is a system….this younger part is so disconnected from the conscious you…that you forgot about me. You forgot that you made a solemn promise…to value our marriage over her desires. How could you forget? If this doesn’t stir a “holy shit….how could I have forgotten?” moment of self-reflection….then I don’t know what to say. One can be wired to be gay, or wired for polyamory. I don’t believe you are wired to be selfish, to lose empathy for others…myself included…when some younger part of you feels threatened. This is learned, and it is tremendously well defended. I feel love and compassion for this part of you….because I love all of you. In my heart of hearts, I desire a relationship with you where we can look at the messiest pieces of ourselves openly. Truly see each other as mirrors with the deepest level of trust. Right now, I can’t have this with you. So, I feel conflicted. I don’t want to be disconnected or disengage….while I too truly would love to hold you in my arms. But I’m sad. I’m sad that this is where you have landed…without remembering. Part of you is closed off to me….and to your conscious self. While I can maybe co-exist with her…. It will cost me and us. There will be a gap that touch and passion  and the intoxicating feeling of connection that is so important to you….and the need I have to feel connected, especially physically, so I won’t feel alone…..can’t bridge. I hope perhaps this won’t always be the case…but for now it is. I know you don’t like it when I analyze things like this. So, I will stop doing that. I will stop sharing my reflections on inner work. I asked you to read the book…which you said you would….and you didn’t. I don’t have anything more to say. I feel sad. Heart-broken, actually. ', 'David', 'Nitzan', '2022-09-14T13:41:32.153000'),
