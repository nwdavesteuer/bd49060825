I love my gift from you (and Alisha). I was a bit worried that I wouldn’t really like it and then have the two of you feel bad…but I really do. I’ve had it in Nathan’s room and it has been keeping me company all day. I enjoy taking a break between calls and just take it in…or maybe go into it. Something about abstract that allows the experience to change depending on what you bring to it at any moment.  I did love our celebration night together….while it almost tipped too hard into being too high or too gluttonous…I definitely was on the edge…it was delightful on many levels. Especially having the occasion to dress up and see you in your sparkly red. With the restaurant table light….you looked luminous…I have a very clear picture of you giggling while I talked to you about space travel.  I know you have planned a special birthday for me in your absence…. being on the receiving end of your planning superpower is something to behold. It is you being creative and generous and caring….and I accept these gifts with all the love I know you are channeling to bring my celebrations to life. I feel so lucky and filled with gratitude to you…and everyone you’ve enlisted to make me feel special.  It would be inauthentic for me not to acknowledge the other feelings about your activities with Garrett tomorrow night. Part of me feels hurt and part of me feels angry.
