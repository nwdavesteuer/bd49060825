Of course, they offered me the top of both those numbers. I told them on the call I wanted 200k and they could do it as a sign on bonus if they were worried about optics. They balked hard at that.

I knew that was what was going on and felt bad because i too really want to celebrate with you and I couldn''t figure out a solution on the fly.  I think we can figure something out that we can make meaningful together. I don''t think I can go with you to my shul on he night of rosh hashanah. That would be bad news right now. We could have dinner together Sunday night (boys will be with Marla) and then either go separately to services (there are actually 2 venues...I''ll explain) and then you can stay over and I''ll take the boys in the morning. During the day, I''ve always wanted to do a special tashlich hike to the ocean from Tennessee valley, near my house. We could do this together in the afternoon. Literally casting off this last year and starting the new year together at one of the most beautiful places on earth...I believe we can create something spiritually powerful with this.  Monday night dinner, I want to cook and have with the boys, but maybe I''ll invite a few other friends over and then it wouldn''t be weird for you. Perhaps that is pushing it...I dunno. So, I know circumstances make things a bit of a challenge this year, but let''s find a way to use the time we can have together to make something special and uniquely ours. I''m sure we can do this.  Ok. Brain fried and I''m falling asleep. More tomorrow my dear. ', 'David', 'Nitzan', '2015-08-21T00:08:32'),

(173397, '1E6977A8-1544-4E95-B608-EB059AF326F7', 'I think what sometimes feel hard about these conversations is when you don''t acknowledge that I''m being left out. Or say something like ''Now that the schedule is finally set, I''m going to figure out how to carve out time for us and we''ll be creative - I just need a few hours to think about how.'' Or something that helps me see that you''re thinking about me, especially given that I''ve expressed sensitivity about this. We both knew that I was feeling bad and we just decided to hang up instead of acknowledge it. For me, I didn''t want to say anything because I''ve already talked about this 4 times and didn''t want to beat a dead horse. I can''t say what was going on for you. This text from you is exactly what I hoped you would have said so it made me feel good. Just maybe an opportunity to kinda think about how the initial conversation could go slightly better.

(173426, 'D6BE4150-9F38-4A4A-B186-3451AA7FA06B', 'Ok. I can do that. Better to acknowledge in the moment the feelings. I just didn''t have a solution, and felt bad, so my reflex is to be quiet until I have something to say.  Another way could be for you to model this as a prompt in the moment, even if you feel like you are beating a dead horse.  I feel a bit the same way. I think my internal monologue was something like, ''I know you feel bad for being left out, and I know you know I feel bad about leaving you out...and that is just the way it is because of the situation and we both are going to have to deal.'' Having the dialogue instead of leaving it to internal monologue certainly could get us to creative solutions faster without both feeling shitty for sure. This won''t be the last time that we will face this issue. Sometimes I will make choices that won''t feel good to you and you might think are wrong...and sometimes they will be wrong. This is new territory for me. My mental model is to put my kids first over what  I might want for myself and for you.....but I''ll be the first to acknowledge that I don''t know exactly how to put them first in certain situations and that even sometimes, despite my intentions, I''m probably putting myself first anyway. I felt bad about even going to New York last weekend, even though it was my weekend ''off.'' I''m not used to this concept of having time that is not always family time, time for myself. On some level I feel guilty about it because I wish despite everything that I had a family that is intact. I told you about this a little bit when I said that I''m not used to not always having to think about what is going on back home and whether the boys are going to actually get picked up etc...All this stuff is going on and it is going to take me time to get it straight.  So my ask of you is to acknowledge that you understand that I''m really just struggling to be the best dad I possibly can be and to push me to make the choices that really do put my kids first even if it might mean sacrificing time together or what each of us might want. This could be the place where ''not ready'' might be pretty much true...this is a lot for me to juggle and I haven''t set up new patterns or a new routine with the kids. Wow. That just made me start to cry a bit. This is not easy.  Thank you for at every turn making the effort to establish better communication with me. It gives me a sense that I am stretching into something that is better. It makes me feel, always,  that engaging with you is nourishing and right. ', 'David', 'Nitzan', '2015-08-21T07:24:19'),
