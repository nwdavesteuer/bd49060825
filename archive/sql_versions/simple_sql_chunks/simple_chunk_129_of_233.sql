The calm before 3 days of non stop talking for 16 hour days. I️’m excited to reconnect with so many people in my industry and have thoughtful conversations. And I️’m also already exhausted by the days ahead. Excited to be in my element. As you’ve said before, these kind of events are my fuel and what fill me up.   And at the same time, I️’m sad because I️ know that this conf is bringing up pain and hurt from our past. I️ get that and it hurts my heart to see you hurt. All I️ can say is that you are my rock, my joy, my soulmate and the man I️‘m so very thrilled to be around 24/7 in our day to day lives. I️ love thinking with you, being pushed to be a better partner with you, being loved for my flaws and blemishes by you. I️ love your endless curiosity, your thirst for books, your joy in being a dad, your insatiable desire for love making and connectedness, your desire to support your kids in all of their life struggles and achieving the right balance of support and restraint. I️’m appreciating you in the deepest way I️ can for the work you have done with me over the last 2 years to repair and strengthen our marriage. I️ come out of these last two years with more resolve than ever that I️ am the luckiest woman alive. I️ have the best husband in the world. I️ am known, seen, and understood. And I️ hope you feel that I️ see you ever day for the courage you have, for the kindness you offer, for the generous heart and soul you have. I️’m touched by your essence and moved by the depth of our bond. I️ know these next few days seem to be really pushing you and I️ want you to know I️ am here in every way.

I don’t want you to worry or be concerned about me. I’ll be fine. It is stirring up lots of chatter in my head and feelings in my body….and this is for me to work through. Repair and forgiveness are not totally linear and in addition all the work we’ve done,  time and distance made it easier to let things settle. I appreciate that there could have been an alternative universe where you are at this conference and I would still be oblivious, but that you chose to not take that path. I am grateful to you for having the strength to be accountable and work so hard to rebuild my trust with you. I don’t want to deny you your relationship, and at the same time, I don’t feel okay with it. I just feel so disrespected by the two of you together. The two of you broke my heart. So even in the light, part of me now just wants to look away and disconnect. This is one relationship where I don’t honestly feel compersion.  AND I feel that I am the luckiest guy in the world married to the most beautiful creature on the planet…inside and out. I want for you to fully be present where you are. We are good.
