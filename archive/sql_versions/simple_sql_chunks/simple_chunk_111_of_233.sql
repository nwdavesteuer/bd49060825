I remember laying in bed at 1am on a chilly Friday night back in February, feeling hopeless, scrolling through an endless maze of job opportunities. At the time, I was working part-time for an amazing nonprofit, but I was not making enough to get by. I’d recently found out about Salesforce Administration, but had been reading that breaking into the field was incredibly difficult. Then all of sudden, I saw this ad for a program called Climb Hire: a program geared toward getting overlooked talent into tech. It was at that moment that I felt hope for the first time since Covid 19 lockdowns had started - somehow, this program seemed right. One that would proudly take in those who had struggled in life - immigrants, those with learning disabilities (like me!), people of color.   I filled out the initial application. I remember a question asking why I wanted to do this. I answered: This program would change my life.   It did.   Recently, I was hired to be one of two founding members for the Salesforce team at Ed-Tech startup, Morressier. This position pays more than double any other job I''ve ever had. But this change isn’t the one that matters. Instead, it’s that now, I believe in myself. I have confidence in myself as a professional and as a leader. A year ago, I wondered if I had a future at all, now I’m asking myself just how bright it can be.   The best part has been watching those I’ve grown to care so much about grow alongside myself. Nowhere is there a community more supportive than that of Climb Hire. These Climbers and staff are all incredible, and seeing where they all go as they too learn to believe in themselves will be amazing.   Thank you for creating this program. It really does change lives.', 'Nitzan', 'David', '2021-10-27T13:49:08.756923'),

When I was on top of you last night and we were talking and I said “let’s have Ken and Ilse wait outside our room.” One minute later….you started on a topic about Ken again. If I ask for the “others” to leave the room, could you please  tell me if there is something else you want to discuss before we shut the door and then honor our space alone? You may remember that you first told me about you having sex with Garrett when I was in the same position….so it is a vulnerable place for me.
