I felt super triggered by how you initiated the conversation, and couldn’t keep myself grounded.  I regret the hurtful things I said in anger and wish I could take them back.   I have a lot stuff racing through my head and body, and I’m sure you do too. But beneath that, my heart hurts right now, and I recognize that yours does as well. So, I want to honor your heart and your feelings, which I’m sure mirror many of mine…from sadness to frustration to anger. I need time and space to settle before I can openly re-engage and listen to you. I get that part of you doesn’t feel seen and heard by me and that there is work for me and for us to do here to improve this aspect of our dynamic. I will spend some time over the next two days reflecting on my part, and I ask that you do the same.  I want to resist the urge to use this channel to try and work through things. We have demonstrated time and again that it is counterproductive. I will make time either Thursday night or Friday for us to talk, if we both feel ready for that. Also open to trying to do so with Priscilla, if you feel that is necessary.  I know you have a big day tomorrow, and I want you to  be able to rest and do what you can to focus your energy on your keynote.

I️ can assure you that I️ talk at no one on my staff for hours on end and lecture them. Happy to share my 360 review with you if you want to understand the actual tension with my team. It’s about prioritization and innovation. I️ just needed to say that because I️’m so hurt by what you think and how you believe that no one on my team wants to work with me. Imagine if I️ said that to you? How rotten you would feel.   I️’m not interested in hashing out anything here on text. But I️ find it really frustrating that you continue to narrate what’s happening, your analysis, and then when I️ jump in with my thoughts you cut me off to say we are back to old habits and legalizing. I️ feel like I️ can’t make a point and you are somehow allowed to.   So those are the things I️’m struggling with. I️ know I️ have made mistakes and I️ should have honored your request to talk about the broader issue at another time. So I️ apologize for not doing that.   We can talk at 9 on Thursday night if you want to come back from MKP early. I️ don’t want to start at convo at 10pm. I️ have a very full workday on Friday since I️’m gone for three days, so it will be harder for me to carve out time on Friday during the day.
